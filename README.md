android weather application - still in progress

This is a weather application I am working on in Android Studio. What is done so far is:
You can search any city or zip code in any country and get the current degree, forecast, humidity, pressure, visibility, and wind mph.
You also get the forecast for the next 4 days including their high temperature for the day.
You can also hit the current location icon to get the weather for the current city you are in if your location services are turned on for 
this application.

What I will be doing next:

Adding high and low temperatures,
Adding a "saved city" page to look up different cities a user has saved,
Change the background according to the forecast,
Making the UI much better,
Other minor changes / fixes...
